# Trener 
Trener is a mobile app for Android OS that serves as a personal coach for boxing training. It helps users train technique, improve fitness, and track their progress – all from the comfort of home, without the need for a coach or gym.
The app was built using .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) — a cross-platform framework from Microsoft that allows developers to create native mobile apps using C# and XAML.
