# ðŸ¥Š Trener

**Trener** is a mobile app for **Android OS** that serves as a personal coach for boxing training. It helps users train technique, improve fitness, and track their progress â€“ all from the comfort of home, without the need for a coach or gym. The app functions as an audiovisual trainer, using voice instructions and visual cues to guide the user through each workout.


The app was built using **.NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI)** â€” a cross-platform framework from Microsoft that allows developers to create native mobile apps using **C#** and **XAML**.
